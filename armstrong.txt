                Java program to check whether a number is Armstrong or not.


1. What is an armstrong number?

	A number which is equal to sum of cube of its individual digits.
	

	Eg : 153 , 370 ,371 are armstrong numbers.
	    


2. How to check a number is armstrong or not ?

	
		2.1    Separate all the digits of a given number 

		2.2    Cube all the individual digits

		2.3    Sum all the cubes of the individual digits

		2.4    If the result is same as the given number then the number is an 
				armstrong number otherwise not.  



		Eg : 153
 
			a.   1 , 5  and 3    (Separate all the digits) 

			b .  1³ ,  5³ , 3³   (Cube all the individual digits)

			c.  1³ + 5³ + 3³     (Sum all the cubes of the individual digits)
			    = 1 + 125 + 27 
			    = 153
		
			d.  The result is equal to the given number . 
				Therefore , 153 is an armstrong number.





			 265 =  	2³ + 6³ + 5³ 
	              	     = 8 + 216 +125 
		 	     = 349

				So, 265 is not an armstrong number.
	     

			371 = 3³ + 7³ + 1³ 
		 	    = 27 + 343 + 1 
		 	    = 371

				So, 371  is an armstrong number.
